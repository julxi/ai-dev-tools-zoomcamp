# Introduction to AI-Assisted Development 

In this homework, we'll build an application with AI.

You can use any tool you want: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Codex, Cursor, Antigravity, etc.

With chat-based applications you will need to copy code back-and-forth, so we recommend that you use an AI assistant in your IDE with agent mode.

We will build a TODO application in Django.

The app should be able to do the following:

- Create, edit and delete TODOs 
- Assign due dates
- Mark TODOs as resolved

You will only need Python to get started (we also recommend that you use `uv`).

You don't need to know Python or Django for doing this homework.


## Question 1: Install Django

We want to install Django. Ask AI to help you with that.

What's the command you used for that?

There could be multiple ways to do it. Put the one that AI suggested in the homework form.

### Answer:
uv add django


## Question 2: Project and App

Now we need to create a project and an app for that.

Follow the instructions from AI to do it. At some point, you will need to include the app you created in the project.

What's the file you need to edit for that?

- **`settings.py`**
- `manage.py`
- `urls.py`
- `wsgi.py`


## Question 3: Django Models

Let's now proceed to creating models - the mapping from python objects to a relational database. 

For the TODO app, which models do we need? Implement them.

What's the next step you need to take?

- Run the application
- Add the models to the admin panel
- Run migrations
- Create a makefile


## Question 4. TODO Logic

Let's now ask AI to implement the logic for the TODO app. Where do we put it? 

- `views.py`
- `urls.py`
- `admin.py`
- `tests.py`


## Question 5. Templates

Next step is creating the templates. You will need at least two: the base one and the home one. Let's call them `base.html` and `home.html`.

Where do you need to register the directory with the templates? 

- `INSTALLED_APPS` in project's `settings.py`
- `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` in project's `settings.py`
- `TEMPLATES['APP_DIRS']` in project's `settings.py`
- In the app's `urls.py`

## Question 6. Tests

Now let's ask AI to cover our functionality with tests.

- Ask it which scenarios we should cover
- Make sure they make sense
- Let it implement it and run them 

Probably it will require a few iterations to make sure that tests pass and evertyhing is working. 

What's the command you use for running tests in the terminal? 

- `pytest`
- `python manage.py test`
- `python -m django run_tests`
- `django-admin test`

## Running the app

Now the application is developed and tested. Run it:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Since we asked AI to test everything, it should just work. If it doesn't, iterate with AI until it works. 


## Homework URL

Commit your code to GitHub. You can create a repository for this course. Within the repository, create a folder, e.g. "01-todo", where you put the code.

Use the link to this folder in the homework submission form. 


## Tip

You can copy-paste the homework description into the AI system of your choice. But make sure you understand (and follow) all the steps in the response.
